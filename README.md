# SingleCellRNAseq-SeuratAnalysis

## Overview
This repository contains an R Markdown file detailing an analysis workflow using the Seurat package for single-cell RNA sequencing data. Seurat is a robust toolkit for such data, offering comprehensive tools for quality control, analysis, and exploration.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive and reproducible workflow for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. This workflow includes steps like data loading, preprocessing, identification of variable features, scaling, and normalization of data, among others.

## Contents
- `SingleCellRNAseq-SeuratAnalysis.Rmd`: The main R Markdown file containing the entire analysis workflow.
- `figures/`: Directory containing individual plots generated during the analysis.
- `plots/`: Directory containing a combined plot of all individual plots for overview purposes.

## Getting Started
To use this repository:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure you have R and the necessary packages (Seurat, dplyr, ggplot2, patchwork, Matrix, gridExtra) installed.
3. Run the R Markdown file in an R environment (like RStudio) to reproduce the analysis.

## Dependencies
- R
- Seurat
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- patchwork
- Matrix
- gridExtra

## Usage
The `SingleCellRNAseq-SeuratAnalysis.Rmd` file can be executed to perform the entire analysis as described in the document. It generates plots saved in the `figures` and `plots` directories.
